This file (SEEK.txt) is not essential for the execution of SEEK.EXE; it
is merely the output (for the most part) from executing SEEK as follows:
  SEEK /V? > SEEK.txt


Installation Instructions
=========================
- SEEK is best used if placed within a directory located in your PATH
  setting.

- SEEK is very easy to use.  You have little to worry about concerning
  where to put options and in what order.  Options can appear anywhere
  on the command-line and can also be combined. For example, all the
  following will do the exact same thing (they are all equivalent):

   1)  SEEK /i /v *.* *.bak

   2)  SEEK *.bak /V /I *.* /vi

   3)  SEEK /iV *.bak *.*

   4)  SEEK *.* /V /I *.bak

   5)  SEEK /v *.bak *.* /IV

   6)  ...  etc.


New Features in SEEK 2.0+
=========================
 1) Incorrectly detected DOS versions.  This has been fixed.

 2) There was a bug with systems that had a non-enhanced keyboard.  This
    has been fixed.

 3) Optimized to be much faster than previous versions and most (if not
    all) other file searching utilities that include as many features.

 4) GREP-like string searching is now available.  The string is simply
    placed between quotes anywhere on the command-line.  However, unlike
    GREP, the string is not displayed; but the offset where it was found
    can be displayed.  The search algorithm is very fast.

 5) New options:
   /B  ---------- begin searching in the current directory.  By default,
                  SEEK begins from the root directory.
   /C  ---------- change to the directory of the first matching file.
                  Execution is also halted with this option.
   /F  ---------- seek only files.  Directory entries are ignored.  To
                  seek only directories, specify the /AD option.
   /L  ---------- ignore letter-case during string search.
   /O  ---------- display the offset where a found string was found
                  within file.  The offset is displayed in hexadecimal.
   /Q  ---------- quit seeking when the first matching file is found.
   /T  ---------- as with option /O, except the offset is displayed in
                  decimal.

 6) All numbers greater than 999 are now displayed with a thousands
    comma separator.  Thanks to Ivan Hofsajer for the original
    suggestion.

 7) SEEK should recognize networks.  A user of a previous version of
    SEEK informed me that the /D option (scan all drives) did not
    recognize all the drives on his network.  This has been fixed, I
    think.  If the network drives are not scanned with the /D option
    now, please let me know.

 8) Pressing <Esc> or <Ctrl-Break> halts execution cleanly.

 9) The directories . and .. (representing the current and parent direc-
    tories, respectively) are no longer displayed.


Detailed Documentation
======================

SEEK 2.03, Copyright (c) 2004, Jody R. Cairns

Syntax:  SEEK  [options]  ["search string"]  [drives:]  files...

Options:  /B  -------------- Begin seeking in current directory
          /C  -------------- Change to directory of found file
          /D  -------------- scan all Drives for files
          /F  -------------- seek only Files; ignore directories
          /I  -------------- show file Info: size, attribute(s), & date
          /L  -------------- ignore Letter-case during string search
          /O  -------------- display Offset where search string is found
                             in hexadecimal
          /P  -------------- Pause after screenful of information
          /Q  -------------- Quit seeking when first file is found
          /R  -------------- Run files if found (must have COM, EXE,
                             or BAT extension)
          /T  -------------- display offset where search string is found
                             in decimal
          /V  -------------- use DOS routines for Video output (slower)
          /A(AHRSD)  ------- seek files by specified Attribute(s)
          /Ecommand  ------- Execute specified command on files
          /S[-]size[-]  ---- seek files by Size specified or by range
          /?, /H  ---------- for more information and syntax examples

- SEEK searches for all the files specified on the command-line and
  displays their full path name if found.

- To search for any string within seeked files, specify the string be-
  tween two (2) quotes (").  If your string contains a quote symbol, use
  2 quotes to represent 1 quote within the quoted string.  The search
  string can appear anywhere on the command-line.

- You can search across different drives.  Just specify the drives you
  want to search followed by a colon.  The /D option (scan all drives)
  is disabled if any drives are specified.

- If you don't want SEEK to scan entire disks, specify the path from
  which to start searching.  Note that only the last file specification
  with a full path name will be considered.  Previous paths are ignored.

- Pressing <Esc> or <Ctrl-Break> at any time halts execution.

- Options can be combined and can appear in any order on the command-
  line.  If an option is specified more than once, the right-most one
  takes precedence.

Explanation of options (examples follow)
======================
  /B  ---------- begin searching in the current directory.  By default,
                 SEEK begins from the root directory.
  /C  ---------- change to the directory of the first matching file.
                 Execution is also halted with this option.
  /D  ---------- scan all drives for files.  This option is overridden
                 if any drives are specified.
  /F  ---------- seek only files.  Directory entries are ignored.  To
                 seek only directories, specify the /AD option.
  /I  ---------- display information of found files: size, date, time,
                 and file attributes.
  /L  ---------- ignore letter-case during string search.
  /O  ---------- display the offset where a found string was found
                 within file.  The offset is displayed in hexadecimal.
  /P  ---------- pause after each screenful of information.
  /Q  ---------- quit seeking when the first matching file is found.
  /R  ---------- run the files if they are found (they of course must
                 have a COM, EXE, or BAT extension).
  /T  ---------- as with option /O, except the offset is displayed in
                 decimal.
  /V  ---------- use DOS routines for output. This is slower but it
                 allows any output to be redirected, if desired.
  /A(AHRSD) ---- seek files by specified attributes. Attributes can be
                 combined in any order as long as the first attribute is
                 preceded by /A. The attributes are: A = Archive, H =
                 Hidden, R = Read-only, S = System, and D = Directory.
                 When combined, an OR comparison is performed on the
                 files.  For example, if the option /AHD was specified,
                 any files with a Hidden OR a Directory attribute are
                 sought for.
  /Ecommand ---- the command specified after this option will be ex-
                 ecuted on found files. The command specified can be any
                 DOS command or executable program (which must be in
                 your PATH).
  /S[-]size[-] - seek files by specified size. There are four seek
                 possibilities:
                  1) /Ssize  ====== find file sizes equal to specified
                                    size.
                  2) /S-size ====== find file sizes less than or equal
                                    to specified size.
                  3) /Ssize- ====== find file sizes greater than or
                                    equal to specified size.
                  4) /Ssize-size1 = find file sizes between the range
                                    specified by size and size1.
Examples
========
1) SEEK  a:*.bak  /vi  c:  /d
   - searches for all *.BAK files on drives A and C, displaying all
     file details and using DOS output routines.  Note that the /d
     option (scan all drives) is ignored since drives were specified.

2) SEEK  /deTYPE  *.tmp  *.$$$  /eDEL
   - searches all drives for *.TMP and *.$$$ files, executing the DEL
     command on any files found.  Note that the command TYPE is not
     executed since /eDEL appears after it.

3) SEEK  /pt  *.*  /id  "A ""quote"""  /o
   - scans all drives for *.* files which contain the string 'A "quote"'
     displaying file information and the offset in hexadecimal where
     the string was found, pausing with each screenful.  Note that the
     /t option (show offset in decimal) is overridden since /o appears
     to the right of it.

4) SEEK  /ad  /arh  *.*  /s0-100  /b
   - searches current drive starting in the current directory for *.*
     files that have either a directory, read-only or hidden attribute,
     and that are between 0 and 100 bytes, inclusive.

5) SEEK  a:  /q  cf:\help.exe  /ri  d:*.zip
   - searches drives A, C, D, and F for the files HELP.EXE and *.ZIP,
     displaying file information, running HELP.EXE if found, and
     quiting as soon as one file is found.
