Files included with UTTER202.ZIP:

   UTTER.EXE --- executable
   UTTER.DAT --- default data file containing quotes
   UTTER.txt --- this file, containing installation instructions, version
                 changes, and detailed documentation for the usage of UTTER.


This file (UTTER.txt) is not essential for the execution of UTTER.EXE; it is
merely the output (for the most part) from executing UTTER as follows:
  UTTER /V? > UTTER.txt


Installation Instructions
=========================
- UTTER is best used within your AUTOEXEC.BAT file; thus, upon start-up, a
  quote will be displayed. My AUTOEXEC.BAT file has the following:
     C:\UTILS\UTTER.EXE /WMK
  This updates the default data file UTTER.DAT automatically if it requires
  updating, displays a quote, then prompts the user to press a key or click
  a mouse button to continue.

- UTTER requires an ASCII data file which contains the quotes to display.
  By default this is called UTTER.DAT; however, this can be over-ridden by
  specifying a different file on the command-line.

- When UTTER is first executed it will create an index file called UTTER.IDX.
  Every data file requires an index file located in the same directory as
  its data file.


Version Changes
===============
  UTTER 2.03 - updated email address of author. (July 4, 2004)
  UTTER 2.02 - when the /V option (DOS output) was specified and output
               was re-directed, quotes were not displayed correctly.
               This has been fixed.  Thanks to Roger Burton-West for
               the original bug report.

  UTTER 2.01 - non-enhanced keyboard bug fixed.
             - number of optimizations made.

  UTTER 2.0  - all options may now be present in the UTTER environment
               variable.  The syntax of the variable is exactly the same as
	       the command-line.  Thus, if the environment had
	 	 UTTER=quotes.dat /vr /w
	       It would be identical as executing UTTER on the command-line
	       as:
	 	 UTTER quotes.dat /vr /w
	       Any command-line options override any environment options if
	       they can be overridden.  Thus, if /V was set in the
               environment, and /D was specified on the command-line, /V
               would be ignored.  However, if /V was set in the environment
               and /R was specified on the command-line, /V would NOT be
               ignored since neither option is related to the other.
               Thanks to Roger Burton-West for the idea.
	     - quotes are now limited to a length of about 2,048 bytes.
	     - the following options have been added:
	        /C  - Clears screen before quote is uttered. Thanks to Dawn
	 	      Torraville for the suggestion.
	 	/G  - displays the value of the environment variable UTTER.
	 	/D  - utter quotes Directly to video memory.  This is the
	 	      default output routine.
                /O  - displays UTTER's Options.
	 	/#  - utter # quotes, where # is greater than or equal to
                      0.  Thus, if /10 was specified, 10 quotes would be
                      displayed.  If # is greater than the number of
                      quotes in the data file, and the /R is not specified,
                      then # is set to the number of quotes in the data
                      file.  Again, credit goes to Roger Burton-West for
                      this one.
                /A  - if the data file is being updated and a no tilde (~)
                      is found at the end of the file, a tilde is Appended
                      to the file.  Some editors add control characters at
                      the end of files, or you may forget to add a tilde to
                      the last quote.  This option adds it automatically.
                /T  - as with the /A option, except the file is Truncated
                      instead of a tilde being added.  The point of
                      truncation is the position where the last tilde was
                      found.  Thus, if your editor added some control
                      characters to the data file that you don't want, this
                      option will get rid of them.  Use this carefully,
                      making sure you are updating a quote data file, not
                      some other vital file, because the file is changed.

         /D  ---------- utter quotes Directly to video memory (default)
         /B  ---------- use BIOS routines for video output (slower)
         /V  ---------- use DOS routines for Video output (slowest)
         /S  ---------- enable video Snow-checking (for CGA monitors)
         /C  ---------- Clear the screen before quote is uttered

         /#  ---------- utter # quotes, where # is a minimum of 0
         /P[x]  ------- Pause for approximately x seconds after quote
                        (default is 2 seconds, maximum is 60)
         /U[A|T]  ----- Update index file, Adding tilde (~) or Truncating
                        data file if tilde is missing
         /E[editor]  -- invoke Editor (EDIT is default)
         /?, /H  ------ for more information

- UTTER displays a quote from an ASCII text data file, called UTTER.DAT
  by default, which is assumed to be in the same directory as UTTER.EXE.

- All quotes in the data file must end with a tilde (~).  The length of
  each quote is limited to 2,048 bytes.

- To use a different data file just specify its full path name on the
  command-line.  If the default data file is in a different directory
  than the executable file, then specify the directory name on the
  command-line, making sure it ends with a `\' character.

- An index file is associated with each different data file, having the
  same name as the data file except with an .IDX extension.

- Each index file must be in the same directory as its corresponding data
  file.  Index files are created automatically if they do not exist in the
  same directory as its data file or if they are corrupt in some way.

- All options may be preset in the UTTER environment variable, having the
  same syntax as the command-line.  Options specified on the command-line
  override any applicable options in the environment variable.

- Options can appear in any order and can be combined.

 Explanation of options (examples follow)
 ======================
   /N  --------- display the number of quotes in the current data file.
   /R  --------- utter a random quote from the current data file.
   /W  --------- disable any warning prompts when creating index file.
   /D  --------- write output directly to video memory. This is the
                 default output method.
   /B  --------- use BIOS routines for output, which is slower. If your
                 monitor acts up and the /S option does not fix it, try
                 this option.
   /V  --------- use DOS routines for output.  This is the slowest but it
                 allows any output to be redirected, if desired.
   /S  --------- enable video snow-checking, which CGA screens may
                 require.
   /C  --------- clear the screen before a quote is uttered.
   /K  --------- prompt the user after a quote is uttered with the
                 following: "Press any key to continue...".
   /M  --------- prompt the user after a quote is uttered with the
                 following: "Click mouse button to continue...".  If the
                 /K option is enabled in addition to this one, the prompt
                 is: "Press any key or click mouse button to continue..."
   /O  --------- display UTTER's options.
   /G  --------- display UTTER environment variable settinG, if it is set.
   /#  --------- utter the number of quotes specified by #, which must be
                 greater than or equal to 0.  If # is greater than the
                 number of quotes in the data file and the /R option is
                 not specified then # is set to the number of quotes in
                 the data file.
   /P[x]  ------ after a quote is uttered, pause for the specified
                 number of seconds, or for 2 seconds by default.
                 Seconds must be >= 0 and <= 60.  If x is specified, the
                 /# option cannot immediately follow x.  Ex: "/P62" ->
                 wrong, "/P6 /2" -> right, "/2P6"-> right.  If the /K or
                 /M options are specified too, the /P[x] option will be
                 executed first.
   /U[A|T]  ---- update current data file, creating an index file for it.
                 If a tilde (~) is missing at the end of the data file,
                 the /A option adds a tilde to the end of the data file.
                 The /T option truncates the data file to where the last
                 tilde was if a tilde is missing.  If the /W option is
                 specified and /A and /T are not, then the data file is
                 unchanged.  Note that the /A and /T options do not have
                 to follow /U; they can appear anywhere on the command-
                 line.
   /E[editor]  - execute, by default, the editor EDIT using either the
                 default data file UTTER.DAT or the file specified on the
                 command-line.  To use a different editor, specify the
                 editor's name immediately after the /E option.

 Examples
 ========
1) UTTER  /11  quotes.txt  /vr  /k
   - displays eleven (11) random quotes from the file QUOTES.TXT using
     DOS output routines and prompts user to press a key afterwards.

2) UTTER  /wu  /eMyEdit  /t
   - executes the editor MYEDIT on the default data file UTTER.DAT, then
     updates the index file automatically after MYEDIT execution halts.
     If the data file contains a quote that does not end with a tilde,
     then that quote is deleted ("/t" option) from the data file.

3) UTTER  /sp5  \utils\  /r
   - displays a random quote from the default data file UTTER.DAT located
     in the \UTILS\ directory using snow-checking, pausing for five
     seconds afterwards.

4) UTTER  /r5p1vw  /u
   - displays five (5) random quotes from the default data file,
     updating it automatically first, pausing for one second afterwards.
     This cryptic example could have been specified a number of ways,
     including "UTTER /r /5 /p1 /v /w /u", or "UTTER /uvp1r5w", etc.
